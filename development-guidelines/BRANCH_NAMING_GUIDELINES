# Branch Naming Conventions

## Prefixes

1. **feat/**: This prefix is used for branches that introduce a new feature or functionality. For example, `feat/login-form` or `feat/search-functionality`.

2. **fix/**: This prefix is used for branches that address bug fixes or minor code improvements. For example, `fix/login-error` or `fix/typo-in-readme`.

3. **chore/**: This prefix is used for branches that involve routine tasks or non-production code changes, such as updating dependencies, refactoring code, or modifying build scripts. For example, `chore/update-dependencies` or `chore/refactor-utils`.

4. **docs/**: This prefix is used for branches that involve changes or updates to documentation files, such as README files, API documentation, or user guides. For example, `docs/update-readme` or `docs/api-documentation`.

5. **test/**: This prefix is used for branches that focus on adding or modifying test cases or improving test coverage. For example, `test/add-unit-tests` or `test/improve-coverage`.

6. **hotfix/**: This prefix is used for branches that address critical bugs or issues in a production environment, typically requiring an immediate fix or patch release. For example, `hotfix/login-security-issue`.

7. **release/**: This prefix is used for branches that prepare for a new release, such as updating version numbers, compiling release notes, or merging features for a specific release. For example, `release/v1.2.0`.

8. **experiment/**: This prefix is used for branches that explore new ideas, proof-of-concepts, or experimental features without the intention of merging them into the main codebase immediately. For example, `experiment/new-ui-design`.

These naming conventions help maintain a consistent and organized structure within the repository, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose and scope of each branch. However, it's important to note that different projects or teams may have their own variations or additional prefixes based on their specific workflow and requirements.
